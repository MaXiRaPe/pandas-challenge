# Results Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to showcase the school performance trends in the city's school district. For this purpose, the standarized test results in math and reading were analyzed in regards to Grade level, and school size, budget and type.

Overall, the district's performance summary shows only 65% of the students passing both math and reading. Individual performance in math has only 75% of the students passing and  86% passing in reading. 

There should be a focus to improve the math skills in the district at every grade level. Not only because of the achievement percentages cited above, but because it can also be observed in how the the average scores remain practically flat when progressing in grade level.

The budget by school and per student was very similar among the 15 schools in the district, with only a maximum range of $77 in spending per student. Therefore, no trend could be observed between the school budgets and the math or reading performance levels.

From the variables considered in this analysis, the most significant impact on both math and reading performances is the school size and type. Small and Medium sized schools (up to 2000 students), surpass the district's performance with about 90% of the students passing both math and reading. Charter schools outperform the District type schools in math by almost 40% and overall by about 20%. It should also be noted that the Charter type schools fall primarily in the small to medium size range, with only one school with a size of 2283 students (and yet performing in the top 5 schools). 

# Credits
In addition to the class exercises, I used different online searches to understand better the syntax and coding options to complete the task. Mostly I used the Pandas API reference documentation to help me with syntax. Google searches were useful to understand error issues and help debug my code. These searches refered me back to pandas reference documentation, stackoverflow or others.
